# envtools
Customized snippet tools to be used

## Introduction

This is not a tool or a package to be used. In this section there are allocated all the snippets and little scripts based on ideas to ease the process. 

## Quality

No quality allocated into the internal scripting. These tools could be not completely operative as they need some kind of credentials to be deployed.

The idea is to be the less time spending possible

## Documentation

Documentation to know about the different usage will be set inside the different files to be delivered
